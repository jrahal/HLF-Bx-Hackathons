## Problem
There is not a single, non-repudiated source of truth for an individual student's education profile & history. Each individual does not own their respective data and is unable to verify, control, or administer access to their data across various parties. 

## Solution
A blockchain platform where students can create a unique digital identity, where each individual retains sovereignty over their unique data. Verified third party entities can provide attestations certifying various data (high school diplomas, grades, SAT scores, certifications, etc.) The individual can grant access to their data for different use cases, such as replacing the Common App for College admissions.

## Technologies
Hyperledger Composer
ReactJS
